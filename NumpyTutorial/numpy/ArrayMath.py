"""
Basic mathematical functions operate elementwise on arrays,
and are available both as operator overloads and as functions in the numpy module:
"""

import numpy as np

x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]], dtype=np.float64)
y = np.array([[5,6],[7,8]], dtype=np.float64)

# Elementwise sum; both produce the array
# [[ 6.0  8.0]
#  [10.0 12.0]]
print(x + y)
print(np.add(x, y))

# Elementwise difference; both produce the array
# [[-4.0 -4.0]
#  [-4.0 -4.0]]
print(x - y)
print(np.subtract(x, y))

# Elementwise product; both produce the array
# [[ 5.0 12.0]
#  [21.0 32.0]]
print(x * y)
print(np.multiply(x, y))

# Elementwise division; both produce the array
# [[ 0.2         0.33333333]
#  [ 0.42857143  0.5       ]]
print(x / y)
print(np.divide(x, y))

# Elementwise square root; produces the array
# [[ 1.          1.41421356]
#  [ 1.73205081  2.        ]]
print(np.sqrt(x))


"""
Note that unlike MATLAB, * is elementwise multiplication, not matrix multiplication.
We instead use the dot function to compute inner products of vectors, to multiply a vector by a matrix,
and to multiply matrices. dot is available both as a function in the numpy module
and as an instance method of array objects:
"""

x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
y = np.array([[5,6],[7,8]])

v = np.array([9,10])
w = np.array([11, 12])

# Inner product of vectors; both produce 219     向量相乘
print(v.dot(w))
print(np.dot(v, w))

# Matrix / vector product; both produce the rank 1 array [29 67]
print(x.dot(v))
print(np.dot(x, v))

# Matrix / matrix product; both produce the rank 2 array
# [[19 22]
#  [43 50]]
print(x.dot(y))
print(np.dot(x, y))


"""
Numpy provides many useful functions for performing computations on arrays; one of the most useful is sum:
"""
x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])

print(np.sum(x))  # Compute sum of all elements; prints "10"
print(np.sum(x, axis=0))  # Compute sum of each column; prints "[4 6]"
print(np.sum(x, axis=1))  # Compute sum of each row; prints "[3 7]"

"""

Apart from computing mathematical functions using arrays, we frequently need to reshape or otherwise
 manipulate(操作) data in arrays.The simplest example of this type of operation is transposing a matrix;
 to transpose a matrix,simply use the T attribute of an array object:
"""
x = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]])
print(x)   # Prints "[[1 2]
               #          [3 4]]"
print(x.T)  # Prints "[[1 3]
               #          [2 4]]"

# Note that taking the transpose of a rank 1 array does nothing:
v = np.array([1,2,3])
print(v)    # Prints "[1 2 3]"
print(v.T)  # Prints "[1 2 3]"
